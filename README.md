Image Overlay is a mod for Cities: Skylines that allows you to show and control an image over your terrain, so you can easily use it as a template for building your city. 

This mod will automatically load any .png images located at "[Steam directory]\steamapps\common\Cities_Skylines\Files\[filename].png".
Images max size is pretty much unlimited, but expect huge load times with images higher than 8192x8192 px
