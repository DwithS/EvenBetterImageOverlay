EvenBetterImageOverlay is a mod for Cities: Skylines that allows you to show and control an image over your terrain, so you can easily use it as a template for building your city. 

This mod will automatically load any .png images located at "[Steam directory]\steamapps\common\Cities_Skylines\Files\[filename].png".
Images max size is pretty much unlimited, but expect huge load times with images higher than 8192x8192 px

Features:
  * Adjustable overlay opacity
  * Dynamic load of .png files 
  * Multiple images to toggle through 
  * Auto fit to 1x1, 3x3, 5x5 or 9x9 tiles
  * Save & Load functions
  * Lock button
